dataslot_0: harmonic overlaps at 10, 24, 50 chirp mass with [0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2] e_10 values 
dataslot_1: rerun with low_frequency_cutoff of 20Hz (increased from 13Hz)
dataslot_2: rerun with n=20 for waveform generation
dataslot_3: appropriately scaled fid e and zero ecc chirp mass for (24 chirp, 0.2 ecc) event
dataslot_4: running with 10, 24, 40 chirp mass
