dataslot_0: first test run calculating degen line and grid data for 24 chirp mass, no spin, 2:1 mass ratio
dataslot_1: dataslot_0 but in 2d chirp-e^2 space with fixed symmetric mass ratio and spins
dataslot_2: dataslot_0 but in 3d chirp-e^2-eta space with fixed spins
dataslot_3: first attempt at 'bouncing' up and down degen line to find best point
dataslot_4: (roughly) same degen line as dataslot_1 but match grids at e=0.1, 0.2, 0.3 for visual (plotted) comparison
dataslot_5: hardcoded 4d degen line testing using phase information to remove width from mapping lines
dataslot_6: added peak finder at start of pipeline using 'scipy' method
