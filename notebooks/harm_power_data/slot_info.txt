dataslot_0: First test with 6 points on each axis and 10 MA vals
dataslot_1: Increased to 101 points on each axis and 40 MA vals
dataslot_2: Fixing distance instead of total SNR, and corrected psd generation bug
dataslot_3: Calculate SNR with overlap instead of match filtering
dataslot_4: As above but bug fixed such that overlap computed at right time (i.e. mergers at same index)
